GardenFlex is a redesign of the Genesis Sample child theme that replaces all the floats and clears, and most of the block and inline elements, with flex elements and their containers.

Or, shorter and more clearly, the Flexbox is baked right in!

The type family Haboro is available in a web-only version from fonts.com. Montserrat is a Google font family enqueued in functions.php.

Photography is mine, from the Devil's Punchbowl, shot in the last year or so - whatever the creation dates are on the files.

Pix and my code revisions are GPL 2.0+; StudioPress code is as well but comes, of course, from the fine folks in that operation.

Enjoy!
